<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a complete, full-stack application for a company called Stabiliq.

**Initial Phase: Landing Page**
The initial request was to build a high-quality, conversion-optimized landing page. This involved several iterations based on user feedback, including significant UI redesigns, incorporating ideas from three reference websites, adding complex animations, and implementing features like a horizontal auto-scrolling testimonial carousel and a fixed sticky header.

**Current Phase: Member-Only Dashboard**
After completing the landing page, the user provided a detailed new set of requirements to build a secure, members-only dashboard accessible after login/signup.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**

1.  **Authentication:**
    *   Create Login and Signup pages.
    *   Use an email + OTP flow (currently in a bypass mode where any OTP works).
    *   Secure the member dashboard, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
    *   Upon successful login, redirect to the Stabiliq Member Dashboard.

2.  **Member Dashboard UI:**
    *   The dashboard must have a clean, premium design consistent with the landing page.
    *   It should feature a main navigation sidebar.
    *   The dashboard will contain three primary sections.

3.  **Dashboard Section 1: AI Upskill & Career Transition Hub:**
    *   Display a list of AI upskilling course video lessons and downloadable PDFs.
    *   Include an AI Transition Toolkit with resources like PDFs, videos, and guides.
    *   Start with dummy data for 6 course modules.

4.  **Dashboard Section 2: Resume & LinkedIn Profile Analysis:**
    *   Provide UI for uploading a Resume (PDF/DOC) or pasting a LinkedIn Profile URL.
    *   Show an Analysis in Progress state after submission.
    *   Prepare a UI structure to display analysis results (e.g., skill gaps, AI readiness).

5.  **Dashboard Section 3: Financial Assistance (Time-Locked):**
    *   This section must remain **LOCKED** for the first **45 days** of a user's membership.
    *   The membership start date is the payment completion date.
    *   Display a countdown or a message indicating the remaining time until unlock.
    *   After 45 days, reveal a Request Financial Assistance button.
    *   Clicking the button should lead to an instruction page listing required documents and an email address to send them to.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
- A feature-rich, multi-section React landing page with advanced animations (Framer Motion) and mock data.
- Frontend Login and Signup pages with a functional (bypass) OTP flow and JWT token handling.
- A basic dashboard layout () with a sidebar, protected by a  component.
- A FastAPI backend with the complete API structure for authentication, user management, courses, profile analysis, and financial assistance. The backend is running and includes the 45-day time-lock logic.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was adding a Member Login Call-to-Action (CTA) section on the main landing page, just before the testimonials section, as requested by the user. The agent created the  component and added it to . It was in the process of visually verifying the implementation with the screenshot tool.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Finalize implementation of the Member Login CTA section. (P0)
  - Issue 2: Potential authentication redirection bug. (P1)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: The agent created the component  and integrated it into . It then attempted to take a screenshot but the view was not correct.
     - Next debug checklist: Use the screenshot tool with scroll options to correctly position the viewport on the new CTA section and verify its appearance and functionality.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a direct user request to provide a clear entry point for existing members from the landing page.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2:
     - Attempted fixes: The agent observed that after logging in, an attempt to screenshot the  page resulted in a screenshot of the  page, suggesting the user session was lost or invalid. The agent restarted the frontend server, which resolved a separate connection error, but the root cause of the redirect was not fully investigated as the user provided a new task.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. Manually test the login flow again.
        2. After logging in, check the browser's local storage to confirm the JWT token is set.
        3. Check browser console logs on the  page for any authentication errors.
        4. Review the logic in  and  to ensure the token is being read and validated correctly on page load.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical bug that breaks the entire member-only area. Fixing it will allow access to the dashboard and unblock all future development within the authenticated part of the app.
     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Build out the content for the Member Dashboard pages. (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: Create the following new components/pages and integrate them into the  router.
        - 
        - 
        - 
     - What will be achieved with this? This will create the three core sections of the member dashboard as specified in the product requirements, making the authenticated user experience functional.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS (Layout exists, but content pages do not)
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
     - Blocked on something: Blocked on Potential authentication redirection bug. The pages can be built, but not tested until the dashboard is accessible.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **Integrate Dashboard Frontend with Backend (P0):** Connect the newly created dashboard pages (, , ) to their respective backend endpoints to fetch and display dynamic data, replacing the current mocks.
    - **Implement File Upload for Profile Analysis (P1):** Build the frontend and backend logic to handle resume file uploads in the  component.
    - **Thoroughly Test Auth and Time-Lock (P1):** Once the dashboard is stable, perform end-to-end testing on the entire authentication flow and specifically test the 45-day time-lock logic for the Financial Assistance section.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Framer Motion (for animations), Axios, TailwindCSS.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic.
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Motor).
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**key DB schema**
  - **users**: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , ,  (hashed), , 
  - **courses**: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , ,

- : Contains the logic for the 45-day time-lock.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Auth is in Bypass Mode:** For both login and signup, any 6-digit OTP (e.g., 123456) will be accepted for verification. This is for development ease.
- **Financial Assistance Time-Lock:** The logic for this is on the backend. The API at  checks if  is greater than 45 days. The frontend must be built to correctly handle the locked and unlocked states based on this API response.
- **Animations:** The frontend heavily uses . Be aware of this when modifying existing components to avoid breaking animations.

11. **user:** Asks to continue building the dashboard and will get the code from GitHub later.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The core authentication flow to access the dashboard is currently not working reliably (the redirect-to-login issue). This blocks progress on the main user-facing features of the dashboard.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- Framer Motion:  (for UI animations)

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: Accessing the  route after login appears to fail, redirecting back to .

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent correctly identified the critical bug where accessing the dashboard redirected the user back to the login page. However, instead of prioritizing and fixing this blocker, it moved on to a new, lower-priority user request (adding the ). The dashboard access issue should have been resolved first.</analysis>
